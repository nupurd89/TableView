##Table Viewer

Run "npm install" and then "npm start" to run on local machine. 

Errors/Needs to be done: 
- The import function only imports the columns and not the filters - ran into a few errors. 
- Filters are different. Same functionality but have "min to max" functionality instead.
- Styling can be cleaned up
- Code is not very neatly set up - rush of time made it hard.
